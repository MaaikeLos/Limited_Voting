This folder contains the code to run the simulations described in Section 6 of 'Limited Voting for Better Representation?'. 
The folder 'Simulation' contains the python code of the simulation, the folder 'Data_Analysis' contains the data that was created by the simulation and used in the paper, and the R code for the analysis. 

For readability the names of the data files in 'Data_Analysis/Data' were changed into more descriptive names, but all these data were obtained by running the code in 'Simulation' with the corresponding parameters.

-------------------------------------------------------------

To run the simulation, make sure you have a working version of python installed, direct your terminal to the 'Simulation' folder and run 'python simulation.py'.

To run the data analysis, open 'analysis.R' in RStudio, set your working directory to the current file ('Session' -> 'Set Working Directory' -> 'To Source File Location') and run the part of the analysis you want.
